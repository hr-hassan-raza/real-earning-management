# real-earning-management
analyze the relationship between either audit fees or CEO power and curtailment of either discretionary SG&amp;A costs or discretionary R&amp;D costs.



## Introduction
Suppose you are working as an accounting researcher and interested in studying the determinants of real earnings management. Based on previous research, you expect that curtailment of
discretionary SG&A costs and/or discretionary R&D costs is related to auditor and/or CEO characteristics, and aim to explore your expectations among U.S. listed firms. More specifically, you will
analyze the relationship between either audit fees or CEO power and curtailment of either discretionary SG&A costs or discretionary R&D costs. Also, you will analyze these relationships among the
index constituents of either the S&P 400 list or the S&P 600 list on December 31, 2020. Furthermore, you will base your analyses on fiscal year 2019 (i.e., this is t, meaning that fiscal year 2018 is t-
1), and in your main regression analysis will control for the influence of firm size, lagged (i.e., t-1) return on assets (ROA), growth, and sector.
NOTE: The Python code that has been used to obtain the constituent lists of the S&P indices on December 31, 2020 can be found on the following website: https://github.com/martscho1.
